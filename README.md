This is my first coding assignment with TOP.
The assignment is to create a simple website that contains recipes.
I'll start with a simple white background with black text.  
There will be 3 links.  Each link will take you another page that will contain the actual recipes.
Recipes will be:
- Jerk Chicken Pasta (Rasta Pasta)
- BBQ Chicken
- Shrimp Stir-fry
